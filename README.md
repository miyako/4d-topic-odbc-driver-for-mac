# 4d-topic-odbc-driver-for-mac

as of v19, the preferred way to access the 4D Server datastore from an external application is to use the [REST API](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/REST_requests). the API is a prorietary protocol that runs on top of the integrated HTTP server to access [dataclasses, attributes and functions](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/manData) as well as [singleton classes](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Concepts/classes#singleton-classes) . [user authentication and session management](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers) is also built in. the feature is exclusive to [project mode](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20/4D/20.2/Converting-databases-to-projects.300-6750126.en.html) and unlocked by the 4D Client Expansion license, not the Web Application Expansion or Web Sercvices Expansion licenses.
