as of v19, the preferred way to access the *4D Server* datastore from an external application is to use the [REST API](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/REST_requests). the API is a [prorietary protocol to access dataclasses, attributes and functions](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/manData) that runs on top of the built-in HTTP server. [user authentication and session management](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers) is supported.
